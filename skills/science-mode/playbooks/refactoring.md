### Refactoring

**You own the contract. The structure changes. The behavior does not.** Distinct from adding behavior (a new feature) and from Bug fix, which corrects it.

If the cleanup reveals a missing feature or a real bug, split it out and ship the structural change first against the pinned contract. A redesign is allowed, but name it and treat it as a separate change. Large or cross-cutting restructuring should be planned on its own before this playbook starts; this playbook is the focused-to-medium change.

1. Pin the behavior contract first. Read the affected code and its callers to learn the contract, then write a characterization test, snapshot, or equivalence harness that captures current numerical behavior (fixed seeds, recorded outputs with explicit `rtol`/`atol`) before any structure moves. If the area has no coverage, write the pin before touching structure. Type check and lint are not a pin.
2. Name the structure the code is missing: model the domain. Pure physical laws (forces, equations of state, rate equations) belong in stateless `physics/` modules, separate from time steppers, meshes, and I/O (`principles/physics-modular-architecture.md`). Boring code stays when the shape is already clear and local. The reshape must delete branches or invalid states, not add indirection.
3. Name the target shape. State what the module layout, types, and call graph should be if built today, starting from first principles rather than from the current layout. If the target crosses a function boundary, sketch the new call graph and the order of moves before you start.
4. Subtract before you add. Delete dead code, collapse one-caller wrappers, drop redundant validators, and remove orphan references before introducing the new shape. The smallest change that reaches the target shape ships. A speculative cleanup that "might help" gets reverted.
5. Move in small behavior-preserving steps, each keeping the pin green. For API reshapes, migrate every caller and delete the old API in the same wave. No compatibility shims, no parallel old-and-new paths. Spot-check every rename against the actual files; renames silently miss usages in strings, prose, and back-references. Delegate mechanical edits to a subagent (`sciencestack:science-master`) with a specific scope (file paths, the names being moved, the behavior to hold).
6. Prove behavior is unchanged on the real artifact, not "it compiles". For larger reshapes, run an equivalence check: a script that diffs old-vs-new outputs, a recorded baseline replayed against the new code, or a smoke run of the real simulation. Conserved quantities and convergence order must be unchanged.
7. Confirm the change is worth keeping. The success measure is reduced reader load. If the diff does not lower reader load somewhere, revert it.
8. Commit in small ordered steps: a subtraction commit, then the reshape, then any follow-on cleanup, each leaving the pin green.

**Reply:** the structure that changed, the pin you held it against, the equivalence proof, the reader-load delta, what shipped and what got reverted. No new behavior.
